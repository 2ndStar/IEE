This is a PCB project for a 60% + XT column keyboard. It has a very specific fixed layout
1. Fixed split backspace
2. Fixed bottom row: 1.5u 1.25u 1.5u 2.75u 2.25u 1.5u 1.5u 1.25u 1.5u

There is a small issue with the "KC_Grave" key located at Row1 Column8.
Take a look at the schematic and fix it for yourself.
